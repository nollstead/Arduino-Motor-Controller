# Project Description

The inspiration for this project stems from my interest in learning robotics.  I initially started with an Arduino and experimenting with various plug-and-play components.  Over time, as you can expect, this led to a mess of wires and interconnects as the number of components grew.  As I also had an interest in circuit design I set to learn how to create my own circuit boards, still based on Arduino but with wires and components on the board.  

This project represents culmination of my learning to date.  It's a shield for an Arduino Mega or Giga that can be used to control a robot car.  Note that this is a hobby project and is NOT a commercial product and has not undergone EMI testing/certification.

It incorporates the following features:
